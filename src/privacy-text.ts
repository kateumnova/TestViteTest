<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p><strong>Effective: December 17 - June 21, 2026</strong></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how personal information is handled for the "HumanPixel Installation" website and web-based lens experience. The installation is a non-commercial, browser-based Snapchat lens created for exhibition visitors and does not collect or store any personal data.</p>

<h3>About HumanPixel Installation</h3>
<p>The HumanPixel Installation is an interactive real-time artwork presented as part of the exhibition "Game Studies," running from 11.02 to 21.06. The lens is built using Snapchat's Lens technology and Snapchat Camera Kit.</p>

<p>When a visitor stands before the exhibition installation and the system accesses the camera, the lens applies augmented reality effects to the live camera stream in real time. The experience is designed purely as an artistic interaction on a shared exhibition computer, like an AR mirror.</p>

<h3>No Personal Data Collection</h3>
<p>The HumanPixel Installation does not collect, store, or share any personal information about visitors. The website does not use cookies, analytics trackers, advertising pixels, or user accounts.</p>

<p>The camera feed is processed locally on the exhibition computer to apply the lens effect and is not recorded or transmitted to the artist, the exhibition organizers, or any third party. No photos, videos, IP addresses, biometric data, or other identifying information are captured or logged by the installation.</p>

<h3>Use of Snapchat Camera Kit</h3>
<p>The lens is implemented with Snapchat's Camera Kit and related web SDKs, which enable augmented reality effects to run inside a browser experience. Camera Kit processes the live video feed on the exhibition device to render lens content and may load necessary code and assets from Snapchat-operated servers, in line with Snapchat's platform documentation and policies. <a href="https://kit.snapchat.com/reference/CameraKit/web/0.22.0/index.html" target="_blank">[CameraKit Docs]</a></p>

<p>In general, Snapchat's services are governed by Snap Inc.'s Privacy Policy and Camera Kit terms, which describe how Snapchat may handle technical data to operate and improve its products. The HumanPixel Installation is configured as a non-commercial, standalone art experience and does not require Snapchat login, social features, or user accounts. <a href="https://values.snap.com/privacy/privacy-policy" target="_blank">[Snap Privacy Policy]</a></p>

<h3>Data Processing and Security</h3>
<p>All augmented reality effects are applied in real time on the exhibition computer using web technologies and Camera Kit. Once the visitor steps away or the page is refreshed/closed, the experience stops and the camera feed is no longer available to the installation.</p>

<p>The site is intended to be served over secure HTTPS, so any communication between the exhibition computer and hosting or Snapchat infrastructure is encrypted in transit, following standard web security practices. No additional backend operated by the artist or exhibition is used to capture or analyze usage data.</p>

<h3>Artistic Rights and Usage</h3>
<p>The HumanPixel Installation lens and all associated creative assets are authored by Kate Umnova. All intellectual property rights in the artistic concept, visuals, and interaction design belong to her, subject to any applicable licenses from Snap Inc. for use of Lens and Camera Kit technology.</p>

<p>The lens is provided solely as part of the exhibition "Game Studies" and is intended for on-site, non-commercial use by visitors. The lens, its assets, or any derivative of the HumanPixel Installation must not be copied, redistributed, embedded, or publicly published without the prior written permission of Kate Umnova. This includes uploading the lens to other platforms or using it in other projects without authorization.</p>

<h3>Your Choices and Controls</h3>
<p>Visitors may step away from the installation at any time to end their interaction. No personal data is collected regardless of participation.</p>

<p>Because the installation does not create accounts or store personal information, there is no user profile to access, correct, or delete. If visitors have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the HumanPixel Installation, they may contact the exhibition organizer or reach out to Kate Umnova via the contact information provided in exhibition materials.</p>

<h3>Changes to This Policy</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies for the duration of the exhibition "Game Studies" (11.02–21.06) and may be updated if technical or legal requirements change. Any material changes will be reflected by updating the text of this policy on the HumanPixel Installation site.</p>
